  description: "Determine whether the module is a Whatsit or a Doodad. This module
    will generate extra edgework for the entire bomb, and in order to do this requires
    the Tweaks mod.\n\nDear mission makers, if you wish to configure your mission
    to customize which widget types can appear in each slot then put [Widgetry] [A]
    [B] [C] in your mission description and replace A, B, and C with the widget types
    you want to appear on those slots. Note that this will only affect 1 Widgetry
    module. If you have multiple Widgetry modules you want to customize you must put
    this line in the description that many times. If you do not all extra Widgetry
    modules will generate normally. Here's the normal Widgetry generation as an example:\n[Widgetry]
    [TwoFactor] [EncryptedIndicator, ModdedPortPlate, VoltageMeter] [BatteryHolder,
    PortPlate, Indicator]\n\r\nHTML: https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Widgetry.html\r\nPDF:
